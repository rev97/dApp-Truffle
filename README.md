# dApp - Validating ML models in a decentralized way
Created to implement decentralized ML in Ganache testnets using Truffle

We have implemented our setup design by using Truffle - Ganache -Remix Suite where smart contracts are developed in solidity. Smart contract that is developed is compiled using truffle and deployed in ganache local servers. 

To implement this setup one needs to have the following items installed in thier local machine

* Ganache Application
* Truffle 
* Web3 python package
* Solidity compiler
